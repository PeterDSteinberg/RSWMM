It was tested with 5.0.022.  It looks like if moving to SWMM version 5.1+, the binary file reader in RSWMM.r would have to be changed (probably a minor change). See item 33 under \"Build 5.1.001 (3/24/2014)\" on this<a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-10/epaswmm5_updates_0.txt\"> EPA page listing SWMM changes by version.</a></h5>\r\n<h6>Synopsis:</h6><p>This R code runs a SWMM input text file repeatedly with modification of the text file based on the last SWMM output and the next trial parameters selected by R optimization code.  The prerequisites for using the code are having a SWMM input file, calibration data, willingness to read code (it's not that bad :)), and willingness to check the output closely as the code is experimental.  These scripts currently only do autocalibration.</p>\r\n<h6>I am working on a similar, separate and larger programming effort (in parallelized Python not R). RSWMM is only a proof of concept. The new effort extends these ideas to a more flexible interface and tiered design optimization.  If you are interested in any of that, or have any feedback on RSWMM, please let me know (see below) </h6>\r\n<h4>Summary of How to Use this Code Efficiently</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Get a SWMM .inp input text file</li>\r\n<li>Read below (a cut and paste of runRSWMM.r) and note each comment's warnings</li>\r\n<li>Choose multi- or single objective</li>\r\n<li>Get your calibration time series CSV in the right format, or use an argument to accomodate your format</li>\r\n<li>Run it after making sure you have disk space or you have edited the code to programmatically delete files</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>runSWMM.r is quoted below.  It is just a lot of help comments around R function calls that use SWMM binary file reader as part of autocalibration.</h4>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n#runRSWMM Developed by Peter Steinberg\r\n#Version 1: December 2011\r\n#Revision 1.1: January 1/10/2012, corrected problem in binary file reader\r\n\r\n#General Notes\r\n#Before editing this script do the following things:\r\n#Move your SWMM file to a directory that can hold a lot of files\r\n#Test that you can run your SWMM file from this directory and you haven't messed up paths to files or something\r\n#Take your SWMM input file and replace the uncertain parameters with codes like\r\n#   $1$, $2$,  $3$\r\n#You can repeat codes if you want the optimization algorithm to repeat a parameter.\r\n#For example, if you know 2 subcatchments should have the same infiltration rate, you\r\n# can put the same code in for their infiltration rates and they will receive the same parameter\r\n#Create a parameter bounds CSV file that looks like this (without the comment sign #):\r\n#                 Code,Minimum,Maximum,Initial\r\n#                 $1$,10,32,15\r\n#                 $2$,10,31,20\r\n#                 $3$,4,15,5\r\n#                 $4$,2,8,7\r\n#                 $5$,25,100,33\r\n#                 $6$,20,75,33\r\n#                 $7$,20,60,50\r\n\r\n#Create a calibration time series data CSV that looks like this (without the comment sign #):\r\n#Date      ,(CFS)\r\n#1/1/07 0:01,0.08\r\n#1/1/07 0:02,0.22\r\n#1/1/07 0:03,0.38\r\n#1/1/07 0:04,0.54\r\n#1/1/07 0:05,0.67\r\n#1/1/07 0:06,0.83\r\n\r\n#REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO USE DOUBLE BACKSLASHES FOR ALL FILENAMES##########\r\n#You have to manually create all directories you provide.
